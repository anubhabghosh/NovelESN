# NovelESN
A novel Echo State Network (ESN) algorithm for predicting very complicated time series without   
the numerical instability issues of the standard one.

## main.py
It receives a txt file with a time series (training data) and it predicts its continuation at certain future instants of time. The program will save and plot the prediction obtained.
The code is run via terminal:  
```
python main.py training_file.txt outputfile.txt tau history_q
```
The user can also specify the optional arguments beta, test_file and history_p, as shown in section examples.

* training_file.txt (string type): Path to a txt file with a single column of values representing a time series of M scalars {y<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, ...y<sub>M-1</sub>}.
* outputfile (string type): Path to the output file where the prediction will be written.
* tau (integer type): Jump in the future. If M-1 is the time index of the last training data value y<sub>M-1</sub>, tau indicates that the prediction will end at instant M+tau (last predicted value will be y<sub>M+tau</sub>).
* history_q (integer type): Determines the amount of predicted values and the beginning of the prediction. The total number of predicted values will be q and they will go from instant M+tau-(q-1) to M+tau.
* beta (optional, float type, default=1e-10): Regularization parameter for a ridge regression equation. See the file equations_doc.pdf for more info. 
* test_file.txt (optional, string type, default=None): Path to a txt file with test data values. The test data is used to know if the prediction is good or not. A perfect prediction should match the test data. If provided, the program will show a plot comparing the prediction and the test data.
* history_p (optional, integer type, default=32): Number of feedback values used to update the reservoir of neurons during training. See equations_doc.pdf for more info.  
  
The user can get a help menu with  ```python main.py -h```
 
### To sum up
Given a time series of M scalars {y<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, ...y<sub>M-1</sub>}, the user will specify a jump in the future tau and a history q. The program will then return a set of predicted values {y<sub>M+tau-(q-1)</sub>, y<sub>M+tau-(q-2)</sub>, ...y<sub>M+tau</sub>}

## System Requirements
Python 3.7 or newer with the following libraries:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn

## Examples
The user must respect the order of the positional arguments. However, the optional arguments can be called in any order by using a dash:
```
python main.py TrainingSignals/dynamo_train.txt dynamo_pred.txt 151 152 -test_file TestSignals/dynamo_test_tau151_q152.txt 
```
```
python main.py TrainingSignals/dynamo_train.txt dynamo_pred.txt 80 50 -beta 1e-9
```

```
python main.py TrainingSignals/sinus_train.txt sinus_pred.txt 99 50 -test_file TestSignals/sinus_test_tau99_q50.txt 
```
```
python main.py TrainingSignals/sinus_train.txt sinus_pred.txt 60 61 -history_p 15 
```
